# What is Web Development?

---

## 1. **Definition**

**Web Development** is the process of creating websites and web applications that people use on the internet.  
Itâ€™s how we build everything from simple personal blogs to complex social networks like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.

## 2. **How the Web Works (Simple View)**

- You type a web address (like `www.example.com`) into your browser.
- Your browser sends a request to a computer called a **server**.
- The server sends back files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Your browser reads those files and displays the website on your screen.

## 3. **Three Main Parts of Web Development**

### **A. Frontend (Client-Side)**
- What you SEE and INTERACT with.
- Built with **HTML** (structure), **CSS** (style), and **JavaScript** (behavior).
- Examples: buttons, menus, images, text, animations.

### **B. Backend (Server-Side)**
- What you DONâ€™T SEEâ€”works behind the scenes.
- Handles data, user accounts, security, business logic.
- Built with programming languages like **Node.js**, **Python**, **PHP**, **Java**, etc.
- Databases (like **MySQL**, **MongoDB**) store and organize information.

### **C. Full Stack**
- A **Full Stack Developer** works on BOTH frontend and backend.
